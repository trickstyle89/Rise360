00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.920
<v ->Try and experiment with me for the next five seconds.</v>

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.020
Don't think about breathing.

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.913
five, four, three, two, one.

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.610
It's hard, right?

5
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.120
Because in truth, we don't think about breathing.

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.590
We just do it.

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.770
But when we're stressed, our quick shallow breath signal

8
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.470
to the brain, that is time to run.

9
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.590
That's great if we're facing a tiger, but not so great.

10
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.960
When we're prepping for an important board meeting

11
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.990
or when we go through long periods of stress

12
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.330
luckily we can override that fight

13
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.660
or flight message to the brain with breath work.

14
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.630
Conscious breathing exercises or techniques designed

15
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.700
to short circuit the stress response

16
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.073
and help us focus or relax.

17
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.350
Let's learn three breathing exercises that are easy to work

18
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.730
into a busy day

19
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.810
and offer benefits right away, including enhanced focus

20
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.140
lower anxiety, and deep relaxation.

21
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.360
We'll start with belly breathing

22
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.450
which is perfect for beginners, to do it.

23
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.500
Lie down on your back or sit in a comfortable position.

24
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.060
Place one hand on your belly

25
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.460
and the other hand on your chest.

26
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.560
Take a deep breath through the nose

27
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.224
and feel your belly expand

28
00:01:21.224 --> 00:01:24.450
as the lungs push the diaphragm down.

29
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.651
Most of the movement should be in your belly

30
00:01:26.651 --> 00:01:29.070
not the chest and shoulders.

31
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.240
Now exhale through your mouth, through pursed lips.

32
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.610
You'll feel the hand on your belly move.

33
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.850
You can even apply gentle pressure to release the last

34
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.683
of the air.

35
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.740
Belly breathing works because it encourages us to

36
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.108
slowly fill our lungs to capacity

37
00:01:46.108 --> 00:01:49.320
which tells the body we're ready to relax.

38
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.820
You can repeat the breath cycle

39
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.409
for several minutes to achieve a deeper state of calm.

40
00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.800
Next is 4-7-8 breathing,

41
00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.966
your secret weapon to get

42
00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:03.420
to sleep or reduce anxiety.

43
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.050
First, blow all the air out from your lungs.

44
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.590
Then inhale through the nose while you count to four.

45
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.900
Internally, count to seven

46
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.420
in your head while holding your breath.

47
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.060
Then exhale for a count of eight.

48
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.673
Repeat the pattern three or more times.

49
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.520
A note of caution, 4-7-8 breathing and other techniques

50
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.990
should not be practiced

51
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.900
while operating machinery or driving.

52
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.320
Breath work may make you feel dizzy or lightheaded.

53
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.260
If you don't feel well during or after breath, work

54
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.930
stop and seek medical attention.

55
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.510
Likewise, if you have any health conditions

56
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.510
you should ask your doctor before starting with breath work.

57
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.850
The third method box breathing is reportedly used

58
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.560
by Navy Seals to help them achieve clarity and focus.

59
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.770
Start by exhaling to empty the lungs.

60
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.430
Then follow a pattern of four counts to inhale.

61
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.480
Four, holding the breath and four counts to exhale

62
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.463
repeat for up to several minutes.

63
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.570
Breath work isn't a miracle cure

64
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.070
but it has been shown to help

65
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.220
with various medical conditions from mental health

66
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.700
and blood pressure to chronic pain and asthma.

67
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.460
And anyone can do elementary breath work to

68
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.300
calm the nervous system and decrease stress and anxiety.

69
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.180
So before pressure mounts, consider getting

70
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.280
into a regular practice using one

71
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.500
of the techniques you've learned today.

72
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.940
Belly breathing, 4-7-8 breathing or box breathing.

73
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.030
That way the next time you are stressed, you can turn

74
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.580
fight or flight into calm, cool,

75
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.413
and collected with breath work.
